        <h3>Biography:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Debut Year (2013)</b>-
                Faker originally started playing League of Legends under the name 고전파 (Which can be read as Go-Jeon-Pa
                or gojeonpa), and initially only played normal games. However, after stacking up on victories, his
                matchmaking rate ended up being so high that the queue times ended up taking too long, which made him
                switch to ranked play. Nearing the end of the second season of ranked play in 2012, Faker ended up being
                ranked second on the Korean ladder, and in the following season claimed the number one spot. At
                first Faker announced himself playing with an amateur team that consisted of himself, Bae "Bengi"
                Seong-woong, Kim "Ssumday" Chan-ho, and two other players. Later Faker was approached by coach Kim
                "kkOma" Jeong-gyun who was a coach for SK Telecom T1, who offered him a position on a team. He was then
                officially announced as the first player for the sister team SK Telecom T1 2 on February 6, 2013.
                With the signing, he also officially changed his gamertag to Faker from 고전파.</li><br>
            <li><b>Sophomore Jinx (2014)</b>-
                After winning the Season 3 World Championship, Faker returned to the Champions Winter 2013-2014, in
                which he dominated. Faker's domination continued until the beginning of Champions Spring 2014, recording
                19 game win streak; a record that was not broken for the next 10 years.[11] Despite the record, Faker
                ended Champions Spring 2014 in quarterfinals and ended the season as the 3rd place in NLB Spring 2014.
                Although Faker managed to win NLB Summer 2014 after ending Champions Summer 2014 at quarterfinals,
                qualifying for the regional finals, Faker failed to qualify for Worlds.</li><br>
            <li><b>SKT T1 Dynasty (2015-2016)</b>-Faker started the year strong by winning his sixth LCK title in Spring
                2017, qualifying to the MSI. Faker and SKT T1 successfully defended the title, becoming the first team
                to win two consecutive MSIs.

                Despite having a bumpy ride in the Summer season, Faker and SKT T1 managed to finish off the season as
                the runner-up, qualifying to Worlds as LCK's 2nd seed.

                After finishing the group stage as group's first, Faker and SKT T1 returned to Finals after a 3-2 in
                quarterfinals against Misfits Gaming and another 3-2 in semifinals against RNG. In both matches, Faker
                stood as the last line of defense protecting the team.</li><br>

            <li><b>First Season of ZOFGK Roster (2022)</b>-T1 started off the year with the
                Zeus-Oner-Faker-Gumayusi-Keria (ZOFGK) roster. Faker and T1 dominated the Spring season, winning the
                season without a single match loss. During this season, Faker reached a total of 2500 kills in LCK.[16]
                They finished the MSI as the runner-up, after a 2-3 loss against RNG.

                After finishing off the Summer season as the runner-up, T1 qualified for Worlds as LCK's 2nd seed. After
                finishing as the group's first place in the group stage, T1 advanced to the knockout stage. Although T1
                managed to take a revenge against RNG in quarterfinals with a 3-0 sweep and proceed to finals after a
                3-1 victory against JDG in the semifinals, T1's journey in Worlds ended with a 2-3 loss against DRX in
                finals.</li><br>
            <li><b>Return of the Emperor (2023)</b>-With the same ZOFGK roster as 2022, Faker and T1 started off the
                Spring season with 17-1 in the group stage, but had to see Gen.G lift up the trophy. One month after the
                beginning of the Summer season, Faker had to take a break in July due to an injury in his right arm and
                hand.[17] After taking a month's break, Faker returned in early August.[18] Faker and T1 then were able
                to finish off the season as the runner-up, securing their spot in Worlds as LCK's 2nd seed.
                Faker with the 2023 World Championship trophy
                After winning the Asian Games as the team captain, Faker made his eighth Worlds appearance with T1.
                Faker and T1 would make their way through the Swiss Stage by only dropping a game to Gen.G Esports.
                After sweeping BLG 2-0 in their last match of Swiss Stage, they first had to face off against LNG
                Esports from the LPL. As they entered the last quarterfinals match, after the fall of all other LCK
                teams in Worlds, T1 had become the "LCK's final hope"[19] by being the only team remaining in Worlds
                outside of the LPL. T1 was were able to sweep 3-0 against LNG. Their next opponent was JD Gaming, a team
                that was looking to complete their "Golden Road" and were seen as the favourites to win the tournament.
