        <P>Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok is the most decorated League of Legends player. He is
            a 28 year
            old Korean, playing

            Faker has won five World Championships (2013, 2015, 2016, 2023, 2024 the most of any player) and two
            Mid-Season Invitationals (2016, 2017), and has 10 combined LCK and Champions Korea titles. He is sometimes

            On May 22nd, 2024, Faker was announced as the inaugural inductee into the Hall of Legends by LoL Esports. He
            was officially inducted at The Shilla Seoul in South Korea on June 6th, 2024.<br><br><br>
            <i>"For more than 12 years, Faker has shown incredible dedication to the game and sport. As the mid-laner
                for
                T1, Faker has long been known for his technical prowess and his ability to make game-changing plays
                earning
                him the moniker “The Unkillable Demon King.” His individual skill and in-game leadership have led his
                teams
                to numerous victories, having earned 10 LCK titles, two Mid-Season Invitational titles, and four World
                Championship titles.

                “Faker is truly the most iconic and influential figure in League of Legends and esports history,” said
                John
                Needham, President of Esports at Riot Games. “His name is synonymous with excellence in LoL Esports, and
                he
                has rightfully earned his place as our very first Hall of Legends inductee.”"</i>
